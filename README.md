# CodeLou_FrontEnd

## Description
```
This is a game for my daughter, who loves matching games. When looking at elementary schools for her, the guides/teachers indicated that children don't know how to use a mouse because of the prevalence of touch screens. I created a matching game so that she can learn how to use a mouse. With images, I can change the game to different themes like family pictures, animals, or cartoons. I added a number to the times clicked as a reference of how quickly the user moves through the game. The game tracks the matched items until the end so that an alert pops up indicating the game is finished. From clicking the bubbles, the reset button, and the alert, my daughter should get plenty of practice using a mouse.



## Custom CSS Classes
```
All CSS was written by me outside the gradients and shadows. I used uiGradients.com for the background and header background. I used a few shadow generators for the bubbles, however tweaked them after appying them to the page.

```

## Custom JavaScript Functions
```
I used 3 to 4 different sources for some of the JavaScript, either for big ideas or small aspects of the code that I couldn't get to work on my own. However the majority was done by me, trial and error. I left most of the trial and error code at the bottom, commented out, to show the progess and ideas that didn't work.
